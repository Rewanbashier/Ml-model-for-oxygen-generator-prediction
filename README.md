project idea: Many diseases , especially respiratory diseases , reduce the level of oxygen in the blood , making patients need to componsate for this deficiency from the outside so we making a device related to an application 
to achieve the complete process , starting from measuring the level of oxygen in the blood until giving the patient the required amount of oxygen , automatically.
Ai Model Part : Ai model take oxygen level in the blood , heart rate from iot sensors inaddition to temperature in celsius from patient that enter temperature through mobile application after that Ai model predict suitable
amount of oxygen for every patient according to previous three features.
I use four models Xgboost , Adaboost , Random forest and  SVR , then ensemble four models together to get final predict amount of oxygen in liter .
unlabeled datasets used from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacobhealth/health-status-dataset ,  https://www.kaggle.com/code/nandalald/predict-covid/input
steps that used to get final prediction:1- integrate previous two datasets together . 2- remove duplicate, null values and change feature weight. 3-use DBSCAN algorithm to divide dataset into clusters so that every cluster contains patients that is similar to each others at oxygen level , heart rate , temperature .4- get helps from experts to labeled that clusters and give every cluster suitable amount of oxygen in liter.5- after get labeled dataset under the name labeled dataset that is download in the code section .6- apply Xgboost , Adaboost , SVR, RandomForest on the labeled dataset , ensemble their result to get amount of oxygen needed for every patient in liters.
